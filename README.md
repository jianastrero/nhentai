This project is dedicated into making a Desktop and Android version of NHentai. It utilizes HTML scalping from the main NHentai Website. It will provide the ability to browse and read manga from NHentai.

### Demo v0.1
| Desktop | Android |
|---------|---------|
|![](nhentai_desktop.gif)|![](nhentai_android.gif)|

## Why?
- No need to open ur browser, lol
- No need to type url
- This program won't save history, so no need for incognito mode
- CSS, JavaScript, etc. won't be processed, so if a virus is ever attached on the page, you won't get affected. HTML will only be interpreted as String, so if there is a executable in the HTML file, it won't be processed.

### Possible Future Improvements
- Show more pages on Home. Currently, only shows the popular manga and 1st page.
- Download Manga into folder
- Search Function
- Search via ID(g/######/)
- Zoom in and out

### If support is given, possible future updates
- Dark Mode
- Download Manga as PDF with PDF viewer
- Download Manga in-app so you can view them offline - so you wouldn't need to:
    - Organize your folders - you won't even need them anymore, all manga will be saved in-app
    - Always see the thumbnail and wouldn't have to view inside the folder anymore

### If big support is given, Ambitious possible updates
- Scalp all manga's possible from NHentai and store it in our own server
